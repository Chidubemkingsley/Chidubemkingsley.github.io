Refactoring code to ensure functions and classes are appropriately sized and have clear responsibilities is crucial for maintainability and readability. Here are some general guidelines and steps you can follow to refactor your functions and classes:

### Evaluating Function and Class Size

1. **Function Size:**
   - Aim for functions that are concise and focused on a single task.
   - If a function spans more than 20-30 lines, consider breaking it down into smaller functions.
   - Each function should ideally perform one logical operation.

2. **Class Size:**
   - Classes should adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): each class should have only one reason to change.
   - If a class is excessively large (more than a few hundred lines), it may be a sign that it's doing too much.
   - Consider splitting large classes into smaller, more focused classes.

### Steps for Refactoring

1. **Identify Large Functions/Classes:**
   - Review your codebase and identify functions or classes that are large and may have too many responsibilities.

2. **Extract Smaller Functions:**
   - Break down large functions into smaller functions that encapsulate specific tasks.
   - Each function should have a clear purpose and ideally be self-contained.

3. **Delegate Responsibilities:**
   - Ensure that each function and class has a clear and singular responsibility.
   - Refactor classes to delegate responsibilities to smaller, more specialized classes or components.

4. **Use Helper Functions/Methods:**
   - Utilize helper functions or methods to encapsulate reusable code snippets or complex operations.
   - This improves readability and reduces redundancy.

5. **Eliminate Code Smells:**
   - Look for code smells such as long parameter lists, deeply nested conditionals, or duplicated code.
   - Refactor these sections to improve clarity and maintainability.

6. **Test After Refactoring:**
   - After refactoring, run your tests to ensure that the behavior of your functions and classes hasn't changed.
   - Refactoring should improve code quality without altering the intended functionality.

### Example Refactoring Scenario

Let's say you have a function `process_data()` that handles data processing and also updates the UI. It might look like this initially:

```python
def process_data(data):
    # Data processing logic
    processed_data = preprocess(data)
    result = complex_algorithm(processed_data)

    # UI update
    update_ui(result)
```

To refactor, you can separate concerns into smaller functions:

```python
def preprocess(data):
    # Data preprocessing logic
    return processed_data

def complex_algorithm(data):
    # Complex algorithm logic
    return result

def update_ui(result):
    # UI update logic
    pass

def process_data(data):
    processed_data = preprocess(data)
    result = complex_algorithm(processed_data)
    update_ui(result)
```

### Commit and Review

After refactoring, commit your changes to your version control system (like Git) and review them to ensure clarity and maintainability. Ensure your refactored functions and classes are well-documented and follow consistent naming conventions.

Refactoring should make your codebase easier to understand, modify, and extend in the future. It's an ongoing process that improves code quality over time.
