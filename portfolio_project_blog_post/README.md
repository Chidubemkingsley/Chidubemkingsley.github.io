### Purpose of the Project

The primary goal of the **Smart Route Planner** project is to help bicyclists find routes with the least elevation between two points, specifically designed to make cycling in hilly areas like San Francisco more accessible and enjoyable.

### Team Members, Roles, and Timeline

As I am the sole developer on this project, I took on multiple roles to bring the **Smart Route Planner** to life. Here’s a brief overview of the timeline and my contributions:

- **Planning & Research**: 2 weeks
  - Studied existing route planning applications and APIs.
  - Defined project scope and technical requirements.
  
- **Design & Development**: 6 weeks
  - Designed user interface for both web and mobile platforms.
  - Developed the core application using JavaScript and integrated mapping APIs.
  
- **Testing & Optimization**: 2 weeks
  - Conducted thorough testing for functionality and user experience.
  - Optimized the application for performance and accuracy.

### Target Audience

The **Smart Route Planner** was created for bicyclists who are looking for a convenient and efficient way to navigate through hilly terrains. This includes both daily commuters and recreational cyclists who prefer routes with minimal elevation.

### Personal Story

Growing up in a small town in Nigeria, I didn’t have much access to modern transportation. My school was quite far, and the only way I could get there was by riding a bicycle. Every morning, I would hop on my bike and ride through dirt roads and small hills, with the sun rising behind me. This daily journey wasn’t just about getting to school; it was an adventure that taught me resilience and independence. I remember the feeling of freedom as the cool morning breeze brushed my face and the sense of accomplishment I felt upon reaching school each day.

Fast forward to today, and I am living in a bustling city far from those rural roads. The memory of those early morning rides inspired me to create the **Smart Route Planner**. I wanted to give city dwellers a taste of the joy and freedom I experienced, by making cycling more accessible and enjoyable, even in hilly urban environments. This project isn’t just about solving a technical challenge; it’s about sharing a piece of my childhood and the lessons I learned on those rides to school.

### Personal Focus

As the sole developer, my focus spanned several areas:
- **User Experience (UX)**: Ensuring that the application is intuitive and user-friendly on both web and mobile platforms.
- **API Integration**: Sourcing and integrating a reliable and sophisticated API that provides accurate elevation data and routing information.
- **Performance Optimization**: Making sure the application runs smoothly and quickly, even with complex routing calculations.

### Example Introduction

**Smart Route Planner** is an innovative project designed to help bicyclists find routes with the least elevation between two points in San Francisco. I, Rubeluchukwuisi Chidubem Kingsley, am the sole developer and have undertaken various roles to bring this project to fruition. This project aims to make cycling more accessible and enjoyable by providing optimal routes through hilly terrains. My primary focus areas included creating a user-friendly interface, integrating sophisticated APIs, and ensuring high performance and accuracy.
