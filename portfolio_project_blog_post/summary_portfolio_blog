*Diagram of the architecture showing the flow of data through the application.*

1. **User Interface (Frontend)**
   - User inputs starting and ending locations.
   - User requests route with minimal elevation.
   
2. **Backend Server**
   - Receives input from the user.
   - Sends request to the mapping API with the userâ€™s input.
   
3. **Mapping API**
   - Processes the request.
   - Returns route information, including elevation data.
   
4. **Backend Server**
   - Processes the API response.
   - Computes the optimal route with minimal elevation.
   - Sends the optimized route back to the frontend.
   
5. **User Interface (Frontend)**
   - Displays the optimized route to the user.
   - Allows users to view and interact with the map.

#### Technologies Used

**Frontend:**
- **HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript:** For building the user interface. We chose these technologies to ensure a solid understanding of core web development skills without relying on frameworks.
- **Leaflet.js:** A JavaScript library for interactive maps. Leaflet.js was chosen for its simplicity and performance in rendering maps and handling geospatial data.

**Backend:**
- **Node.js and Express.js:** For building the server-side logic. Node.js was chosen for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, making it suitable for handling multiple requests efficiently. Express.js, a web application framework for Node.js, was used to simplify the server setup and routing.
- **Google Maps API:** For fetching route and elevation data. Google Maps API was selected due to its reliability, comprehensive data, and ease of integration.

**Database:**
- **MongoDB:** For storing user preferences and historical data. MongoDB was chosen for its flexibility and scalability, making it easy to handle diverse data structures.

#### Key Features

1. **Route Optimization with Minimal Elevation:**
   - **Description:** Users can input their starting and ending points, and the application calculates the optimal route with the least elevation.
   - **Value:** This feature provides cyclists with an easier and more enjoyable riding experience by minimizing uphill climbs.

2. **Interactive Map Interface:**
   - **Description:** The application displays the optimized route on an interactive map, allowing users to zoom in, zoom out, and view different parts of the route.
   - **Value:** Users can visually see their route and make adjustments as needed, enhancing their planning and navigation experience.

3. **User Preferences and Historical Data:**
   - **Description:** The application saves user preferences and historical routes, allowing users to quickly access their favorite or most used routes.
   - **Value:** This feature adds convenience by enabling users to save time and effort when planning regular trips.

### Summary

The **Smart Route Planner** project was designed to help bicyclists find routes with minimal elevation, making cycling in hilly areas more accessible. The architecture of the application involves a seamless flow of data between the user interface, backend server, and the Google Maps API. We used HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for the frontend, Node.js and Express.js for the backend, and MongoDB for data storage. Key features such as route optimization, interactive map interface, and user preferences enhance the overall user experience, making the application valuable for cyclists seeking easier routes.
